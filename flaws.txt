know flaws made for the sake of simplicity
no password hashing
no jwt token verification
no performance concerns 
no user crud operations
missing unit test(project has a developing time of roughly 150 hours. there is no future plan for scaling)
no global endpoint constant which might make the project hard to run on other machines
